        <p>
            Vegan ice-cream became the norm and in truth, it tasted as good, or better.
            I guess realising that it was better for the planet and better for animals, made it all the easier to enjoy.
            It was a clean treat.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cashews</li>
            <li>Vanilla Bean Paste/Vanilla Bean Extract/A Vanilla Bean</li>
            <li>Coconut Milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recipe instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure your cashews are completely soaked from before. Also ensure your ice cream maker freezer base is
                in the freezer for at least 7 to 24 hours before (preferably 24 hours) . If you just keep it in your
                freezer, then it’s always ready!
            </li>
            <li>In a high speed blender, blend the soaked cashews, coconut milk, vanilla bean paste, cane sugar and the
                sea salt together until completely smooth, about 2-4 minutes on high speed depending on your blender.
                You want to ensure it’s 100% smooth, so feel free to blend longer until you’re sure all the cashews are
                blended out. If that means you need to blend longer, definitely blend until fully smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour mixture into a bowl, container or leave in the blender and cover. Sometimes the mixture can get hot
                while blending. Place it in the fridge for 4 hours in the coldest spot, up to 2 days if you don't plan
                to make the ice cream immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from the fridge. Set up your ice cream machine and place the ice cream maker freezer base into
                the machine and pour the ice cream mixture in. Prepare according to manufacturer settings, for about
                20-25 minutes of churning. The mixture should be thick and smooth. If you're not using an ice cream
                maker, check out my chocolate avocado post for no churn instructions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scoop the soft serve ice cream into a container (I use a loaf pan) and smooth down. Place plastic wrap
                or a reusable wrap or parchment or wax paper flat against the ice cream, then wrap the outside of the
                pan too. You want to ensure it's all protected from ice crystals. Place in the freezer for at least 4
                hours to set up, even overnight if you desire. You can also enjoy it immediately like soft serve!
            </li>
            <li>
                After at least 4 hours in the freezer, remove container from freezer and allow it to sit for at least 5
                minutes on the counter (like you would store bought ice cream). Scoop, serve and enjoy!
            </li>
